# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive audit logging capabilities to track all write operations performed by users on RabbitMQ clusters. The audit system will record detailed information about each write operation including the user, target cluster, operation type, affected resources, and timestamps. The feature will be configurable and include a dedicated UI for administrators to view and filter audit records.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all write operations to RabbitMQ clusters to be automatically audited, so that I can maintain a complete record of changes made to the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs any write operation on a RabbitMQ cluster THEN the system SHALL record an audit entry with user ID, cluster ID, operation type, resource details, and UTC timestamp
2. WHEN a write operation is performed THEN the system SHALL capture the operation type from the following list: create exchange, create binding for exchange, publish message to exchange, delete exchange, create queue, create binding for queue, publish message to queue, move messages to another queue, purge queue, delete queue
3. WHEN an audit entry is created THEN the system SHALL include the specific resource that was modified (exchange name, queue name, binding details, etc.)
4. WHEN a write operation fails THEN the system SHALL still record an audit entry indicating the attempted operation and failure status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure whether audit logging is enabled or disabled, so that I can control system overhead and compliance requirements based on my organization's needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL read a configuration property to determine if audit logging is enabled
2. IF audit logging is disabled THEN the system SHALL not create any audit entries for write operations
3. WHEN audit configuration is changed THEN the system SHALL apply the new setting without requiring application restart
4. WHEN audit logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL log all write operations regardless of user role

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want audit data to be stored in a dedicated database table with proper schema, so that audit records are persistent and queryable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is initialized THEN the system SHALL create an audit table with columns for user ID, cluster ID, operation type, resource details, timestamp, and operation status
2. WHEN a new database migration is applied THEN the system SHALL create the audit table structure without affecting existing data
3. WHEN audit entries are stored THEN the system SHALL use UTC timestamps for consistency
4. WHEN the audit table is queried THEN the system SHALL support efficient filtering by user, cluster, operation type, and date range

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to access a dedicated UI to view audit records with filtering and pagination capabilities, so that I can efficiently review system activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the audit UI THEN the system SHALL display audit records in a paginated table format
2. WHEN viewing audit records THEN the system SHALL show timestamps in the user's local timezone by default
3. WHEN an administrator applies filters THEN the system SHALL support filtering by user, cluster, operation type, date range, and resource name
4. WHEN pagination is used THEN the system SHALL maintain applied filters across page navigation
5. IF a non-administrator user attempts to access the audit UI THEN the system SHALL deny access and return appropriate error

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the audit UI to follow the same design patterns and coding standards as existing pages, so that the interface is consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit UI is rendered THEN the system SHALL use the same styling, layout, and component patterns as existing resource pages
2. WHEN the audit API is called THEN the system SHALL require a valid authentication token
3. WHEN the audit feature is implemented THEN the system SHALL follow the existing layer separation with models, services, repositories, controllers, DTOs, and exceptions
4. WHEN audit data is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the same table components and pagination controls as other resource lists

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the audit system to integrate seamlessly with existing write operations, so that no existing functionality is disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing write operations are executed THEN the system SHALL continue to function normally regardless of audit configuration
2. WHEN audit logging fails THEN the system SHALL not prevent the original write operation from completing
3. WHEN audit entries are created THEN the system SHALL not significantly impact the performance of write operations
4. WHEN the audit feature is disabled THEN the system SHALL have minimal overhead on write operations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want audit records to be tamper-evident and complete, so that I can rely on them for compliance and security investigations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audit entries are created THEN the system SHALL ensure they cannot be modified or deleted through normal application operations
2. WHEN a write operation is attempted THEN the system SHALL record the attempt even if the user lacks sufficient permissions
3. WHEN audit data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL include all relevant context about the operation and its outcome
4. WHEN multiple operations are performed in sequence THEN the system SHALL record each operation as a separate audit entry
