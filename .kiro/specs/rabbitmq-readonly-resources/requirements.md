# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The RabbitMQ Readonly Resources feature extends the existing RabbitMQ Admin application to provide comprehensive viewing capabilities for RabbitMQ cluster resources. This feature allows users to browse and inspect connections, channels, exchanges (with bindings), and queues from their assigned RabbitMQ clusters through a read-only interface. The feature leverages the existing RabbitMQ proxy backend and adds new frontend components for resource visualization and management.

## Requirements

6. WHEN viewing exchange bindings THEN the system SHALL distinguish between queue bindings and exchange-to-exchange bindings
7. WHEN exchange topology is complex THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and search capabilities for exchanges and bindings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view all queues in my assigned RabbitMQ cluster, so that I can monitor queue status, message counts, and consumer activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the queues page THEN the system SHALL display all queues with their current status
2. WHEN queue data is displayed THEN the system SHALL show queue name, messages count, consumers count, memory usage, and state
3. WHEN there are many queues THEN the system SHALL implement pagination with configurable page sizes
4. WHEN a user clicks on a queue THEN the system SHALL show detailed queue information including arguments, policy, and statistics
5. WHEN queue details are shown THEN the system SHALL display message rates, consumer details, and queue bindings
6. WHEN queues have different states THEN the system SHALL use visual indicators for idle, running, and flow states
7. WHEN queue data includes consumer information THEN the system SHALL show consumer tags, channels, and acknowledgment modes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the RabbitMQ proxy backend to support readonly operations for all resource types, so that the frontend can retrieve comprehensive resource information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend receives requests for connections THEN the system SHALL proxy to RabbitMQ Management API `/api/connections` endpoint
2. WHEN the backend receives requests for channels THEN the system SHALL proxy to RabbitMQ Management API `/api/channels` endpoint
3. WHEN the backend receives requests for exchanges THEN the system SHALL proxy to RabbitMQ Management API `/api/exchanges` endpoint
4. WHEN the backend receives requests for queues THEN the system SHALL proxy to RabbitMQ Management API `/api/queues` endpoint
5. WHEN the backend receives requests for bindings THEN the system SHALL proxy to RabbitMQ Management API `/api/bindings` endpoint
6. WHEN RabbitMQ API supports pagination THEN the system SHALL pass through pagination parameters (page, page_size)
7. WHEN RabbitMQ API responses include pagination metadata THEN the system SHALL forward pagination information to the frontend
8. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent navigation and filtering across all resource pages, so that I can efficiently browse and find specific resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on any resource page THEN the system SHALL provide navigation tabs for connections, channels, exchanges, and queues
2. WHEN resource lists are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide search functionality for filtering by name or properties
3. WHEN pagination is available THEN the system SHALL show current page, total pages, and allow page size selection
4. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators and skeleton screens
5. WHEN no data is available THEN the system SHALL show appropriate empty state messages
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with retry options
7. WHEN resource data is refreshed THEN the system SHALL maintain current page and filter state

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time or near real-time updates of resource information, so that I can monitor current cluster state effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is viewing resource lists THEN the system SHALL provide a refresh button for manual updates
2. WHEN resource data is refreshed THEN the system SHALL update counters, states, and statistics
3. WHEN auto-refresh is enabled THEN the system SHALL periodically fetch updated data at configurable intervals
4. WHEN data updates occur THEN the system SHALL preserve user's current page, filters, and selection state
5. WHEN network errors occur during refresh THEN the system SHALL show error indicators without disrupting the current view
6. WHEN resource details are open THEN the system SHALL include detail information in refresh operations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend components to follow the existing application design patterns, so that the new features integrate seamlessly with the current UI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resource pages are rendered THEN the system SHALL use the existing Material UI theme and component library
2. WHEN navigation is implemented THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing sidebar navigation structure
3. WHEN data tables are displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent table styling, sorting, and pagination patterns
4. WHEN detail views are shown THEN the system SHALL follow existing modal or drawer patterns for detailed information
5. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN the system SHALL use the existing toast notification system
6. WHEN loading states are shown THEN the system SHALL use consistent loading indicators and skeleton screens
7. WHEN responsive design is considered THEN the system SHALL ensure resource pages work on mobile and tablet devices

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access RabbitMQ resource pages only for clusters I have permission to view, so that security and access control are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses resource pages THEN the system SHALL validate the user has access to the selected cluster
2. WHEN cluster selection changes THEN the system SHALL clear previous resource data and load data for the new cluster
3. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL redirect to the dashboard with an appropriate error message
4. WHEN JWT tokens expire during resource browsing THEN the system SHALL handle re-authentication gracefully
5. WHEN users have no assigned clusters THEN the system SHALL prevent access to resource pages
6. WHEN cluster connections are inactive THEN the system SHALL display appropriate warnings and disable resource access

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for RabbitMQ API interactions, so that issues can be diagnosed and resolved effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RabbitMQ API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including cluster ID, endpoint, and error details
2. WHEN network timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate timeout handling and user feedback
3. WHEN RabbitMQ cluster is unreachable THEN the system SHALL display cluster connectivity status and error details
