# Cluster Management Icon Options

Here are some good icon alternatives for Cluster Management if you'd like to change it:

## Current Choice: `DnsRounded`

- Represents DNS/server infrastructure
- Good for cluster/server management context

## Other Great Options:

1. **`Dns`** - Similar to DnsRounded but with sharp corners
2. **`Hub`** - Represents network hub/central connection point
3. **`DeviceHub`** - More modern hub representation
4. **`AccountTree`** - Tree structure (good for cluster hierarchy)
5. **`Lan`** - Local area network representation
6. **`CloudQueue`** - Cloud infrastructure
7. **`Inventory`** - Server inventory management
8. **`DataObject`** - Data/server objects
9. **`Schema`** - Database/infrastructure schema
10. **`Workspaces`** - Multiple workspace management

## Visual Distinction from Resources (`ViewList`):

- Resources uses a list/table icon (ViewList)
- Cluster Management now uses infrastructure/network icon (DnsRounded)
- Clear visual separation between data viewing vs infrastructure management

To change the icon, just update the import and usage in `/src/utils/icons.tsx`
