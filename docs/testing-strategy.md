# Testing Strategy & CI Optimization

## Overview
The project has been optimized to prevent CI timeouts while maintaining test coverage. The strategy separates fast unit tests from slower integration tests.

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- **Location**: `**/*.test.tsx` (excluding `*.integration.test.tsx`)
- **Runtime**: < 8 minutes
- **When**: Every push/PR
- **Command**: `pnpm test:ci` or `./scripts/run-tests.sh ci`

### Integration Tests  
- **Location**: `**/*.integration.test.tsx`
- **Runtime**: 30-45 minutes
- **When**: Only on main branch pushes
- **Command**: `pnpm test:integration` or `./scripts/run-tests.sh integration`

## CI Environment Variables

### `SKIP_INTEGRATION_TESTS=true`
Skips all integration tests to prevent timeouts in CI.

### `SKIP_PROBLEMATIC_TESTS=true`  
Skips specific tests that are known to cause issues in CI environment (e.g., MUI select component tests).

## Configuration Files

### `vitest.config.ts` (Development)
- Standard configuration for local development
- Includes all tests
- Reasonable timeouts for debugging

### `vitest.config.ci.ts` (CI Optimized)
- Aggressive timeouts (5s test, 3s hooks)
- Parallel execution enabled
- Excludes integration tests by default
- Fail-fast on 3 failures
- No coverage collection

## Scripts

### `./scripts/run-tests.sh`
Smart test runner that:
- Sets appropriate environment variables
- Handles timeouts gracefully
- Allows different modes (unit/integration/ci)

### Package.json Scripts
```bash
pnpm test:unit        # Unit tests only
pnpm test:integration # Integration tests only  
pnpm test:ci          # CI-optimized unit tests
```

## Known Slow Tests

### Frontend Integration Tests (Skipped in CI)
- `ResourceDataFlow.integration.test.tsx` - Complex component interactions
- `QueuesList.integration.test.tsx` - Heavy DOM rendering
- `AuditFlowEndToEnd.integration.test.tsx` - Full workflow simulation
- `WriteOperations.integration.test.tsx` - API integration scenarios

### Problematic Unit Tests (Conditionally Skipped)
- `CreateBindingDialog.test.tsx` - MUI Select component issues in CI

## Timeout Strategy

| Environment | Test Timeout | Hook Timeout | Job Timeout |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Local Dev   | 10s          | 10s          | N/A         |
| CI Unit     | 5s           | 3s           | 45min       |
| CI Integration | 8s        | 5s           | 90min       |

## Backend Test Optimization

### Unit Tests
- Memory allocation: 2GB (reduced from 4GB)
- Timeout: 15 minutes
- Profile: `test` (no TestContainers)

### Integration Tests  
- Memory allocation: 2GB (reduced from 4GB)
- Only critical tests: `RabbitMQResourceControllerTest`
- Timeout: 20 minutes
- Profile: `integration-test` (with TestContainers)

## Monitoring & Maintenance

1. **Weekly Review**: Check for new slow tests that should be moved to integration category
2. **Timeout Adjustment**: Increase timeouts if too many false failures occur
3. **Environment Variables**: Update skip patterns as needed
4. **Performance Profiling**: Use `--reporter=verbose` to identify slow tests

## Local Development

Run the full test suite locally before pushing:

```bash
# Run everything
npm run test

# Run only what CI will run
SKIP_INTEGRATION_TESTS=true SKIP_PROBLEMATIC_TESTS=true pnpm test:ci

# Run integration tests locally
pnpm test:integration
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Tests timing out in CI"
1. Check if new tests should be marked as integration tests
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Consider adding specific test to skip list

### "False failures in CI" 
1. Increase specific test timeout using `vi.timeout()`
2. Check for race conditions in async tests
3. Verify mocks are properly reset between tests

### "CI running too long"
1. Identify slow tests with `--reporter=verbose`
2. Move slow tests to integration category
3. Consider splitting large test files
