# RabbitMQ Resource Management User Guide

## Overview

The RabbitMQ Resource Management feature provides a comprehensive interface for browsing and monitoring RabbitMQ cluster resources. This read-only interface allows you to inspect connections, channels, exchanges, and queues from your assigned RabbitMQ clusters.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Valid user account with access to at least one RabbitMQ cluster
- Active cluster connection configured by an administrator
- Web browser with JavaScript enabled

### Cluster Access and User Assignments

Access to RabbitMQ clusters is controlled through user assignments configured by administrators:

- **User Assignment**: Administrators assign specific users to cluster connections
- **Role-Based Access**: Both USER and ADMINISTRATOR roles can access assigned clusters
- **Multiple Clusters**: Users can be assigned to multiple cluster connections
- **Active Clusters Only**: Only active cluster connections are accessible for resource browsing
- **Assignment Management**: User assignments can be updated when creating or modifying cluster connections

**Note**: If you don't see any clusters available, contact your administrator to verify your cluster assignments.

### Accessing Resource Management

1. **Login** to the RabbitMQ Admin application
2. **Select a cluster** from the dashboard or cluster selector
3. **Navigate** to the Resources section using either:
   - **Sidebar Menu**: Click the Resources section in the sidebar menu
   - **Direct URL**: Navigate directly to `/resources` or specific resource pages like `/resources/connections`
4. **Choose** the resource type you want to explore:
   - **Connections**: Active client connections (`/resources/connections`)
   - **Channels**: Communication channels within connections (`/resources/channels`)
   - **Exchanges**: Message routing components (`/resources/exchanges`)
   - **Queues**: Message storage and delivery queues (`/resources/queues`)

## Navigation and Interface

### Cluster Dashboard Navigation

The cluster dashboard provides access to RabbitMQ resources:

- **View Resources Button**: Navigate to the integrated resource management interface within the application

### Sidebar Navigation

The sidebar provides organized access to all application features:

**Resources Section** (requires cluster access):

- **Connections**: View all active client connections
- **Channels**: Browse channels across all connections
- **Exchanges**: Explore message routing exchanges
- **Queues**: Monitor message queues and their status

**Management Section** (admin-only):

- **Users**: Manage user accounts and permissions
- **Clusters**: Configure and manage cluster connections

Each section and resource type is represented by a consistent icon throughout the application for easy identification and navigation.

The navigation automatically:

- Highlights the currently active resource type
- Disables menu items when no cluster access is available
- Adapts to different screen sizes for mobile and tablet use

### Breadcrumb Navigation

The application includes breadcrumb navigation at the top of pages to help you understand your current location and navigate back to parent pages:

- **Dashboard**: Always available as the root navigation point with a dashboard icon (automatically included on all pages)
- **Cluster Management**: Shows when viewing cluster connection management pages
- **Resources**: Shows when viewing any resource management page
- **Current Resource**: Displays the specific resource type you're currently viewing

#### Breadcrumb Features

- **Automatic Dashboard Root**: All pages automatically include Dashboard as the first breadcrumb item
- **Consistent Icons**: Each breadcrumb item includes an appropriate icon for visual context
- **Clickable Navigation**: All breadcrumb items (except the current page) are clickable for quick navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Breadcrumbs adapt to different screen sizes and maintain readability
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear visual distinction between clickable and current page items

Breadcrumbs are especially useful when navigating deep into resource details, managing cluster connections, or when accessing pages via direct URLs. The Dashboard breadcrumb provides a consistent way to return to the main application overview from any page.

### Direct URL Navigation

The application supports direct URL navigation to resource pages, enabling:

- **Bookmarking**: Save direct links to specific resource types
- **Deep Linking**: Share URLs that navigate directly to resource views
- **Browser Navigation**: Use browser back/forward buttons seamlessly
- **URL Structure**:
  - Main resources page: `/resources`
  - Specific resource types: `/resources/connections`, `/resources/channels`, `/resources/exchanges`, `/resources/queues`

**Note**: Direct URL navigation requires authentication and cluster selection. If accessing a resource URL without a selected cluster, you'll be redirected to the dashboard to choose a cluster first. The application properly handles page refreshes and initial loading states to prevent premature redirects during startup.

### RabbitMQ Management UI Access

While the integrated resource browser provides comprehensive read-only access to RabbitMQ resources, you can also access the native RabbitMQ Management UI directly:

#### Accessing the Management UI

- **Direct URL Access**: Navigate directly to your cluster's management URL (typically `http://your-cluster:15672`)
